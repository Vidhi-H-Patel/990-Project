# 990-Project
Looking at 990 Forms of all the hospitals in the U.S. and comparing expenses. 

## Motivation
The driving question we wanted to answer was: "If EMRs are charging so much, why are they charging so much?"

To understand this, we decided to look at 990 forms of hospitals, and their "information technology" expenses.
